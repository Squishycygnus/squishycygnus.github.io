Markdown is powered by [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev). This is an example to demonstrate all the basic Markdown syntax. You can author content using the familiar Markdown syntax you already know.

## Inline formatting

Bold: **This text is bold**.

Italics: _This text is italics_.

Strikethrough: You can ~~strikethrough~~ text.

Inline code: You can add code like this `const hello = "world"`.

```md
Bold: **This text is bold**.

Italics: _This text is italics_.

Strikethrough: You can ~~strikethrough~~ text.

Inline code: You can add code like this `const hello = "world"`.
```

## Headings

The following HTML `<h2>`â€”`<h6>` elements represent five levels of section headings. `<h1>` is also available but not recommended since the post title is already a `<h1>` element it is not a good practice to have more than one `<h1>` element in a page.

## H2: Heading Two

### H3: Heading 3

#### H4: Heading Four

##### H5: Heading Five

###### H6: Heading Six

```md
## H2: Heading Two

### H3: Heading 3

#### H4: Heading Four

##### H5: Heading Five

###### H6: Heading Six
```

## Paragraph

A standalone single paragraph of text.

Paragraphs can be multiline too when they constitute words that make up more than one line, i.e they wrap to the next line. Wow! I am really smart to write two lines of text that makes zero sense.

```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. And it's pretty long too. Long enough to wrap to next line. Surely it will wrap.

> You can use other Markdown syntax like `inline code` within a blockquote.
